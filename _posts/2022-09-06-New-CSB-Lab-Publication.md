Check this beauty, it's [out](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.05.506644v1)! A renewed working group to explore how operons and higher order gene clusters assemble in time. We use theoretical considerations and results from Metabolic Control Analysis to highlight that once we consider copy number variations introduced by chromosome replication into the equations of a metabolic systems..metabolite pool are perturbed. A way to minimize them? *Operons!*
