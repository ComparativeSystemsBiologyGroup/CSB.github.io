# The alpha-proteobacterial cell cycle

Since 2010, in collaboration with Dr Emanuele Biondi, DR (CNRS, France). Our curiosity is very broad in this field, from the role and effects of DNA methylation in Caulobacter, to the role of small RNAs in controlling some of the players of the cell cycle..and so on and so forth.
However, the most exciting thing is integrating all the available information to get evolutionary understanding of how the cell cycle controlling circuits got assembled.

# Plants, plant pests and related stuff

After a few years at the Fondazione Mach, I am also involved in some collaboration related to plants. Mainly with Dr. Azeddine Si-Ammour, Dr. Mirko Moser (FEM), Prof. Alessandro Botton and Prof. Franco Meggio (UNIPD). And now with colleagues at UNIMI (Prof. Silvia Toffolatti)

# Comparative Systems Biology

Mainly with Dr. Marco Fondi (UNIFI)

# Bacterial genomics

Continuous interactions with the Prof. Davide Sassera group (UNIPV) in Pavia concerning pathogen genomics, the evolution of antibiotic resistance and the like. Trying to make comparative genomics more quantitative and hypothesis driven than descriptive.

# Vector-borne diseases

Still in its infancy as a research line for me. But intense collaborations with the super group [EntoParLab](www.unimi.it) where we belong to.
