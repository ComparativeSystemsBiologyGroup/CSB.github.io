description: "I studied Biology at the University of Florence, the city where I grew up. During my MS degree my passion with bioinformatics, also thanks to my mentor at the time, Pietro Lio' (Cambridge University). At the time I worked on molecular evolution problems, with a focus on how metabolic pathways came to existence. At the end of my PhD I realized that a genuine understanding of many of the problems we were working on with comparative genomics approaches (notably, the cell cycle in the alpha-proteobacteria), we needed a mathematical formalization. In 2008 I left Florence and moved to Lyon to work with Dr. Daniel Kahn and then Dr. Marie-France Sagot. With the former, I dig into dynamical models of metabolism, with a thorough formation on metabolic control analysis. With the latter, I deepened my knowledge of complex networks and algorithms for their analysis.
In 2013 I started a new position in Italy, at the Fondazione Edmund Mach near Trento, in north Italy. There I came back to omics data analysis focusing on one important grapevine pathogen, Plasmopara viticola. Since 2017, I am at the Department of Biosciences at the University of Milan, as a Professor since 2019, where I got affiliated to the EntoparLab (www......it).
Here I am trying to combine my -omics expertise with mathematical modeling in different organisms and scales, from molecules, to populations."
