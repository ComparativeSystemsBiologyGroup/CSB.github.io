After a lot of reasoning, thinking, formalizing, making errors in derivatives,
graduating (Pietro), we are currently releasing a new chapter in our replication saga.

[On the interaction of replication and transcriptional regulation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.20.533469v1)

Take home messages:
1. Replication introduces position- and division time-dependent patterns in the sensitivity of a gene to the activity of its regulator.

2. The interaction of copy number variations introduced by changes in division time with
a regulator's activity can be constructive or destructive. In the first, correlations with copy number and the activity of the regulator
are detectable in the output, in the second, a partial decoupling from copy numbers or regulator's activity introduces an additional 
gauge for gene expression modulation

3. Considering replication could be important for (i) gene regulatory network reconstruction,  (ii)
promoter and regulator kinetic parameter estimation and (iii) dispersion factor estimation across different conditions in RNA-seq data analysis.

Now we will explore how replication may affect the degree and nature of
genome structural variations.
